        <h3>Gojo Sotoru</h3>
        <div class="disc">Satoru Gojo (Japanese:Hepburn: Gojō Satoru) is a fictional character from Gege Akutami's manga Jujutsu Kaisen. He was first introduced in Akutami's short series Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School as the mentor of JuJutsu High training the cursed teenager Yuta Okkotsu while dealing with his friend Suguru Geto. This miniseries became the prequel Jujutsu Kaisen 0 of Jujutsu Kaisen. In Jujutsu Kaisen, Gojo takes the same role but this time he mentors the student Yuji Itadori who suffers a similar curse and wants him to help him be stronger while protecting other characters from the series.

            Gege Akutami created Gojo to be a strong but likable character who is keen into his students. He was voiced by Yūichi Nakamura in Japanese and Kaiji Tang in English in the animated adaptations by MAPPA. Gojo has been a highly popular character, appearing not only in polls from Jujutsu Kaisen but also anime in general. Critics enjoyed the way he is portrayed in the manga and anime due to his balance between a strong teacher and at the same time friendly man.</div>
